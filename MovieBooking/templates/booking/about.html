          <p class="lead">"I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms,
          the most immediate way in which a human being
          can share with another the sense of what it is to be
          a human being."</p>

          <p class="mt-4">Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers,
            typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place,
            often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song,
            music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality,
            presence and immediacy of the experience</p>
